          <p>Agile Singapore is a non-profit organisation that consists of a group of volunteers, whom have dedicated their time to raising the awareness of Agile Software Development in Singapore. Agile software development has its genesis in the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org" target="_blank">Agile Manifesto</a> and the principles brought forth there. It has since become a well known but not necessarily a well practiced way of doing software.</p>
<p>Agile Singapore aims to further spread the awareness about agility in the context of software development as well as challenge and inspire those who are practicing agility to further successes.</p>
