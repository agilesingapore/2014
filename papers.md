          <p>Agile software development has itâ€™s genesis in the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org" target="_blank">Agile Manifesto</a> and the principles brought forth there. It has since become a well known but not necessarily a well practiced way of doing software. We intend this conference to further spread the awareness about agility in the context of software development as well as challenge and inspire those who are practicing agility to further successes.</p>
