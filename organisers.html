        <h2>John Lim</h2>
        <p>John is a software developer who is passionate about his craft. Even with many successful projects under his belt, there was always the nagging feeling that something was not quite right.

        <h2>Slawek Rogulski</h2>
        <p>Slawek is a software developer. He is a problem solver and an all round deep thinker always looking for the right abstractions. After 15 years of enterprise software development he is still enjoying the craft. Lately he has developed a passion for building great teams, what makes them tick and what tips the scales from a group of smart people to a top flight team? An even bigger challenge that has occupied him on occasion is reconciling the rhythm of developing software with the rhythms of the business without compromise. He was born in Poland, raised in Australia and now "stays" in sunny Singapore.</p>
