        <h2>Day 1 Keynote: The Power of an Agile mindset</h2>
        <p>I've wondered for some time whether much of Agile's success was the result of the placebo effect, that is, good things happened because we believed they would. The placebo effect is a startling reminder of the power our minds have over our perceived reality. Now cognitive scientists tell us that this is only a small part of what our minds can do. Research has identified what I like to call "an agile mindset," an attitude that equates failure and problems with opportunities for learning, a belief that we can all improve over time, that our abilities are not fixed but evolve with effort. What's surprising about this research is the impact of an agile mindset on creativity and innovation, estimation, and collaboration in and out of the workplace. I'll relate what's known about this mindset and share some practical suggestions that can help all of us become even more agile.</p>

        <h2>Day 2 Keynote: Enabling the organisation as a complex eco-system</h2>
        <p>This presentation will take an ecological approach to understanding how business functions and IT capability can better interact with each other.  It will argue for a substantial shift away from the predominantly manufacturing and linear metaphors that underly code development, user requirements capture and project management.  Instead we need to see technology provision as a service relationship which can both deliver core needs, but can also joining explorer the rapidly emerging opportunities offered by technology in the modern world.  It will focus on how we understand the Implicit Whys of customer and employee needs not just the Explicit Whats.  As such it will challenge some of the common assumptions behind big data and demonstrate how human sensor networks (whole of workforce engagement for example) can transform the enterprise.  For the Agile community that means developing pre-Scrum capability, for the wider business it means understanding how to co-evolve unstated needs with the rapidly changing capabilities of technology.</p>

        <h2>Day 3 Keynote: Build a Workplace People Love - Just add Joy</h2>
        <p>Joy in the context of business sounds ridiculous, and would be except for one important glaring fact: it produces measurable, repeatable, and sustainable results. Learn why from the founder, CEO, and Cheif Storyteller and author Richard Sheridan. <br><br>

        Within an industry known for missed deadlines, poor quality, "death march" processes and user experiences that requireDummies books to explain, this talk will deliver the hope of a better way. Attendees who attend agile and scrum conferences are searching for  tangible examples from which to sample and learn. This talk will deliver inspiration and practical takeaways.<br><br>

        Agile methodologies practiced The Menlo Way™ since 2001 are both joyful and disciplined. In this session, Sheridan will share from him personal experiences about the effects of physical space on team energy and engagement, the benefit of simple paper-based project management tools to foster better sponsor relationships, the power of systematic pairing in creating a learning organization that render towers of knowledge and Brooks' Law quaint challenges of the past.<br><br>

        Sheridan will discuss the cultural norms that remove fear and encourage experimentation; you'll hear about the elimination of meetings and the rituals and ceremonies that replace them. Learning Objectives: 1) Design a culture with the right team and leadership in a learning environment; 2) create client involvement; 3) define your environment by joy in an open and collaborative culture and 4) create delightful user experiences.</p>

        <h2>You Can’t be Great without Technical Excellence</h2>
        <p>Technical excellence is more than two week sprints, a burn-down chart and a daily stand-up meeting. The basic rules of Agile or Scrum are not an end in themselves, but rather a staring point based upon principles and practices that allow and encourage teams to adopt, adapt, and refine their craft.  Unfortunately, it may seem to the technical people that agile is just another micro-management approach.<br>
		Extreme Programming with its provocative name, got people’s attention in 1999.  It is based on sound technical practices.  Why do so few agile teams employ engineering practices that support the tight iterative cycles of Agile and Scrum?  The founders of Scrum expected the continuous improvement cycle to pull engineering practices into teams once the cycle revealed the problems of poor product quality, hard to change code, wasted time debugging, long stabilization efforts and the ever growing burden of manual test.<br>
		In this talk we’ll look at why the technical practices of test-driven development, refactoring, continuous design, clean code and automated testing can help you and your organization be great.</p>

        <h2>Constructive Action in the Face Of Technical Debt</h2>
        <p>When we plan and manage projects, we are seldom given a blank page. We have staffing and scheduling concerns, and a variety of other issues to contend with, but below each of them is the one thing that affects completion and effort more than anything else: the quality of the existing code.<br>
		In this talk, Michael Feathers will outline managerial and team strategies for moving projects forward in the context of code that is hard to change.  We'll talk about how to manage risk, how to create new opportunities moving forward, and how to work in ways which avoid to creation of further problems in large existing code bases.</p>

        <h2>Journey to Agility for a Large Scale Telecom System - Reflections from the road</h2>
        <p>Since the birth of Agile Manifesto, many companies have started their Agile transformation journeys. Working as an Agile coach, I have had the honor to help out and to learn. In this session, I will share some key learning, challenges and experience from a large scale legacy telecom product during its Agile transformation journey.</p>

        <h2>Worse Is Better, for Better or for Worse</h2>
        <p>Nearly two-and-a-half decades ago, Richard Gabriel proposed the idea of “Worse Is Better” to explain why some things that are designed to be pure and perfect are eclipsed by solutions that are seemingly compromised and imperfect. This is not simply the observation that things should be better but are not, or that flawed and ill-considered solutions are superior to those created with intention, but that many solutions that are narrow and incomplete work out better than the solutions conceived of as being comprehensive and all encompassing. Whether it is programming languages, operating systems, development processes or development practices, we find many examples of this in software development, some more provocative and surprising than others. <br>
		In this talk we revisit the original premise and definition, and look at how this approach to development can still teach us something surprising and new.</p>
