          <p><a href="http://odd-e.com" target="_blank">Odd-e</a>, based throughout east Asia, are self-governing teams of highly skilled and experienced software developers, coaches and trainers. Their software products are crafted so skillfully they actually cost less time and money than seemingly cheaper alternatives. Because of this built-in quality the product remains soft and easier to change meaning reduced overall costs and delays in the longer-term. We uphold the values of Scrum, Agile, Lean, and Craftsmanship both with our clients and within Odd-e. For example, we don't have an organisational hierarchy; No managers making decisions for others and no assistants being managed. We keep our space open to new thinking and leaderful teamwork with each team member able to use appropriate skills and continuously improve individual and team competence.</p>
