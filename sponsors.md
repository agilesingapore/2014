Their software products are crafted so skillfully they actually cost less time and money than seemingly cheaper alternatives. Because of this built-in quality the product remains soft and easier to change meaning reduced overall costs and delays in the longer-term. We uphold the values of Scrum, Agile, Lean, and Craftsmanship both with our clients and within Odd-e. For example, we don't have an organisational hierarchy; No managers making decisions for others and no assistants being managed.
