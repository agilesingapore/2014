Our team consists of experienced coaches and product developers who work according to the values of Scrum, Agile, Lean, and Craftsmanship. We also use these values to structure and run our company. For example, we don't have an organisational hierarchy or managers making decisions for others. We expect each individual to self-organize and use all his skills and continuously improve his competence.</p>

With a complete suite of courses that cover all roles and activities on Agile teams, we have trained and coached over 7,000 staff in adopting Agile concepts since 2007. Adopting Agile practices requires much more than attending a training course; for many organisations it is a fundamental shift in the way they work, and Software Educationâ€™s experts work with the whole organisation delivering training, providing advice and support, coaching and mentoring at all levels to help ensure the organisation achieves the benefits of the Agile culture and mind-set.</p>
